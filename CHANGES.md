# Changes Made to Varta Application

## CORS Issue Fix
The CORS issue was fixed in the backend by updating the CORS configuration in `server-simplified.js`. The configuration now properly includes the frontend origin in the allowed origins list:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://frontend-dot-varta-455515.uc.r.appspot.com'],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true,
  preflightContinue: false,
  optionsSuccessStatus: 204
}));
```

This ensures that preflight requests from the frontend to the backend API endpoints (including the registration endpoint) will pass the access control check.
